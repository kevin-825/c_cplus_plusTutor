• Computer Memory �
• Pointers/Addresses �
• Arrays 
• Memory Allocation


1.Stack contains local variables from functions and 
related book-keeping data

2. Pointers are integer variables themselves, so can 
have pointer to pointers: char **ptr; 


char        1byte
short int   2byte
int         4byte
long int(long) 4byte
bool        1byte
float       4 byte
double      8 byte
long double 8 byte


3.Can use void pointers, just cannot dereference without casting

4.Array variables are pointers to the array start! 
5. Array indexing is same as dereferencing after pointer addition. 
 str[1] = ‘a’ is same as *(str+1) = ‘a’ 
6.  No string data type in C. Instead, a string is interpreted as a null-terminated char array. 
Null-terminated = last char is null char ‘\0’, not explicitly written . String literals use “ ”.
Compiler converts literals to char array. 
    char str[] = “abc”; 

7. #include <string.h> 


8.Mem alloc
• #include <stdlib.h> 
• sizeof (a C language keyword) returns number of bytes of a data type. 
     sizeof(char)
     sizeof(int)
